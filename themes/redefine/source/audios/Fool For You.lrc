[00:08.272]I been running over leaving in my head
[00:11.991]Trippin' over all the stupid things you said
[00:16.216]I keep stallin', and now I'm fallin'
[00:20.631]It's like I'm constantly questioning you
[00:25.020]So if you want me
[00:27.249]Why are you tearing me apart
[00:29.650]It's killing me slowly
[00:31.817]Watching you hide behind your scars
[00:34.060]Not here when I need you
[00:36.076]I been trying to pull through
[00:38.333]You play with my mind
[00:39.773]Play with my mind
[00:40.872]Play with my mind
[00:42.577]But i'm just a fool for you
[00:44.787]I play it cool for you
[00:46.916]Every night, feeding me lies, I turn a blind eye too
[00:51.558]I'm just a fool for you
[00:53.545]I'm just a fool
[00:55.183]For
[00:56.291]You
[00:58.202]I'm just a fool for you
[01:17.590]I know you always tell me what I want to hear
[01:21.899]It's like it's deafening the silence when you're near
[01:26.160]All these blurred lines, but I still hold tight
[01:30.600]Hoping you give me something that is real
[01:35.228]So if you want me
[01:37.206]Why are you tearing me apart
[01:39.556]It's killing me slowly
[01:41.590]Watching you hide behind your scars
[01:43.867]Not here when I need you
[01:45.812]I been trying to pull through
[01:48.060]You play with my mind
[01:49.666]Play with my mind
[01:50.716]Play with my mind
[01:52.271]But i'm just a fool for you
[01:54.754]I play it cool for you
[01:56.860]Every night, feeding me lies, I turn a blind eye too
[02:01.055]I'm just a fool for you
[02:03.341]I'm just a fool
[02:05.249]For
[02:06.465]You
[02:08.605]I'm just a fool for you
[02:27.503]So if you want me
[02:29.610]Why are you tearing me apart
[02:31.958]It's killing me slowly

[02:47.358]I play it cool for you
[02:49.290]Every night, feeding me lies, I turn a blind eye too
